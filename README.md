When setting up the bot, create a file called `.env` inside the `src` folder.  
In that file, add the following lines:

DISCORD_TOKEN=(your bot's token)  
CLIENT_ID=(your bot's Client ID)

After that, run the following command to install dependencies:

npm install discord.js

If you have other dependencies listed in your `package.json`, you can run:

npm install

to install them all.
